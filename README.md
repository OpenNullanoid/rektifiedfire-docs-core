## What is Depth Walker?

Depth Walker is an action-packed first-person shooter (FPS) game that falls under the sci-fi action-adventure genre. Directed by Kabir Akzaman and developed by OpenNullanoid community contributors, Depth Walker is an exciting project to work on.

In the game, players take on the role of RektifierKX, an advanced robot agent created by Mechmorphix, a reputable AI technology company working with law enforcement agencies in Kioxia city.

The notorious DarkWave criminal organization has been conducting illegal activities within Kioxia, providing high-tech gadgets to criminals. However, when the organization's human personnel escaped, they left behind valuable information under the protection of their dangerous machinery.

As RektifierKX, players must infiltrate the abandoned DarkWave facility stealthily, collect information and avoid detection. By using exceptional skills and making strategic decisions, players uncover secrets and stop criminal activities to restore order to Kioxia.

Through immersive stealth gameplay, intense action, and intriguing storylines, players explore the facility's depths, uncovering corruption and criminal activities that must be stopped.
