# This is where the fun(and potentially stress) begins!

Here, you'll (may) find all the essential files necessary for keeping our development on track. 
From project timelines to game engine details, guidelines, and mechanics, we've got it all covered(pretty much). 
No more endless searching and confusion - we've got everything you need right here(I hope so), so you can focus on making our game the best it can be!
